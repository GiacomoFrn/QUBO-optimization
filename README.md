# QUBO-optimization

Benchmarking of different encodings for a Quadratic Unconstrained Optimization problem to be solved with D-Wave quantum annealing platform. 

The optimization problem is a variation of the knapsack problem, where we want to optimize the number of photos taken by a satellite given their values, a finite set of cameras and a number of different constraints.
